<p>
Are you hurting？<br>
Feel like dying？<br>
I wonder<br>
Do theatrics<br>
Ease your pain or<br>
Feed a hungry soul<br>
Hysterics<br>
Overreaction<br>
I wonder<br>
Why my feelings<br>
Play supporting<br>
To your leading role<br>
I'm disillusioned by your ways<br>
Your prancing on a paper stage<br>
The curtain call has come<br>
Final scene, you change your act<br>
And don a grownup stoic mask<br>
Too late, bow, we're done<br>
No, please just go<br>
I've nothing more to say<br>
So no, let it go<br>
There's nothing left to say<br>
A virtuso on the stage<br>
Your…<br>
A virtuso on the stage<br>
Your every move exuded grace<br>
I was overcome<br>
I recited lines by heart<br>
Scripted by your flawless art<br>
I am much to blame<br>
Forget these days<br>
I won't play house again<br>
So, forget this time<br>
I'll keep my secrets mine<br>
